      <h1>What we borrowed in ML from info theory</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">Notes on entropy, KL, cross-entropy, and mutual information in modern ML.</p>

      <p>
        This post is a short set of notes on how core ideas from information theory shape modern machine learning—loss functions, uncertainty measures, and model evaluation. More details and examples to come.
      </p>

      <h2>Key concepts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Entropy as a measure of uncertainty and its role in regularization.</li>
        <li>Cross-entropy and KL divergence as optimization objectives and evaluation metrics.</li>
        <li>Mutual information for feature selection, representation learning, and bottleneck methods.</li>
        <li>Connections to compression, coding, and generalization.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Further sections will include worked examples and links to foundational references.
